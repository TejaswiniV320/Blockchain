and this ledger cannot be altered or modified. 


2. What is the core problem Blockchain trying to solve?

--Solved Problem of Trust
--Implemented Tamper Proof Distributed Ledger
--Established processes for Business Transaction Recording, Verification and Publishing.


3.What are the few features which Blockchain will give you?

--Peer-to-peer transmission
--Transparency
--Irreversibility of records
--Computational logic


4.What all things does a Block Contain?

-- Current Block number
-- Data/Information
-- Signature of the Previous block
-- Mining key


5.How is the verifiability of Blockchain is been attained?

In real time Blockchain networks, the verifiablity is achieved by the validation of a data which is newly entered into the network. 
This validation is done by the remaining nodes of the network , thus in the network if more than 51% of the nodes validate and
verify then the verifiability is achieved .
